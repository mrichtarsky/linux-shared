# Setup script for SLES and Ubuntu development machines

Sets up a common directory structure, installs helpful tools and config files. Config files will be symlinked to the repo version and thus shared among all users. Be aware of that for `root`, and don't use this in production!

Optimized for VS Code, bash and tmux. Can reattach to running tmux sessions from the console and keep opening files from the command line.

See [settings.sh](https://github.com/mrichtarsky/linux-shared/blob/main/env/settings.sh) and [functions.sh](https://github.com/mrichtarsky/linux-shared/blob/main/env/functions.sh) for bash aliases and functions.

# Usage

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/mrichtarsky/linux-shared.git /projects/repos/linux-shared
sudo /projects/repos/linux-shared/setup_system.sh
```

You can also change `/projects/repos/linux-shared` to some other dir.

For every user that should have the setup, run `/r/install.sh` as the user.

# Directory Structure

/r -> /projects/repos/linux-shared  # This repo - Easy access to all scripts etc.
